Stratus has its own build server called **Cloudy**. Cloudy makes building maps with others or by yourself simple and easy! To get started, connect to the server using the address `play.stratus.network` and type `/server cloudy`. The following guide will explain how to create a world, choose the world settings, and how to add people to your world.

# 1. Main Menu

When you first spawn in the Cloudy lobby, you spawn with a book in your inventory. The book will give you access to the **Main Menu** which allows easy access and creations of worlds. To access the main menu, **right click** the book. 
 
The main menu has 3 main sections:
 
- The player skull: Clicking this will take you to a world creation page.
- The compass: After creating your world you can use this sub-menu to change world settings .
- The book and quill: Clicking this item will allow you to customize individual preferences, however this will not be covered in this guide.

# 2. Creating a World

Creating a world is simple, open the main menu and click on the player skull. It will take you to a page that looks like this:

Clicking on the **green clay block** will teleport you to your world. Now, you can begin building!
 
If you want to teleport to someone else's world, you can use the command `/tp [playername]` or `/world tp [world name]`. To return to your world, you simply need to reopen the main menu, click on the player skull, and finally click on the **green clay block**.

Please note that you only get one world to build in, if you want more worlds you need to [buy a rank to unlock them](https://stratusnetwork.buycraft.net/).

# 3. Changing your World Settings

Once you create your world, you might want to change some settings. With Cloudy you can toggle rain, day cycles, explosions, fire spread and more using **flags**! To do so, teleport to your world, open the main menu and click on the compass. You will see a page that looks like this:

This submenu lets you add builders, change world settings, and download the map.

- Pickaxe: Clicking on this will take you to another menu that allows you to add builders.
- Banner: Clicking on this will take you to another menu that allows you to change settings.
- Minecart: Clicking on this will let you download your world.
 
To change world settings click on the banner, it will take you to a page like this:

Each item is a setting and hovering over them will tell you which setting it is. Clicking on a item will disable/enable the setting. For example, clicking on the clock will disable the daylight cycle and clicking on it again will enable it.

Each item has a different function:
- Spawn Egg: `Animals` - Toggle animal spawning in this world
- Stick: `Entity Collision` - Toggle entities interacting in this world
- Ice: `World Freeze` - Toggle building and interacting in this world
- TNT: `Explosion` - Toggle explosions working in this world
- Wood Hoe: `Permanent Farmland` - Toggle farmland from disappearing naturally
- Flint & Steel: `Fire` - Toggle fire from spreading/combusting in this world
- Leaves: `Leaves` - Toggle leaves from decaying in this world
- Spawn Egg: `Monsters` - Toggle monsters from spawning in this world
- Night Vision: `Night Vision` - Toggle automatic night vision in this world
- Lime Wool: `Public` - Toggle any player from entering in this world
- Clock: `Night/Day` - Toggle time from changing in this world
- Water Bucket: `Rain` - Toggle raining in this world

# 4. Adding/removing builders

Collaborators are one of the most prime aspects of mapmaking. To add the ability for users to edit your world, you must click the **diamond pickaxe** in the main GUI menu.

Once you click that, you are greeted with a green clay block and a red clay block. The functions of them are that:
- Red clay will remove builders from the selected world
- Green clay will add builders to the selected world

To change which permissions a builder has in your world, you must click on the player head that corresponds with their name once hovered over. Clicking on them will open a menu with all of their permissions, and you may individually edit permissions that users will have in your world. Always be cautious with who you add!

Each different item has a different function:
- Wooden Axe: `Building` - Toggle building and interacting
- Book: `Commands` - Toggle having permission to all commands
- Paper: `Edit Comments` - Toggle being able to edit and read comments
- Skull: `Edit Builders` - Toggle being able to add and remove builders
